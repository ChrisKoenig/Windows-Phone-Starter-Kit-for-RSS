  This section contains the separate RSS or ATOM feeds consumed by the application.  Each feed
  contains the following elements - both of which are REQUIRED:

    Title - the common title of the feed for display on the page
    RssUrl - the URL for the rss or atom data feed for the content

  The "m:" markers (called Namespaces in XML) are REQUIRED for the application to function
  properly. If you want to add more feeds, simply copy an existing one and change the data.

  Also - for each of the RSS feeds, you need to ensure that the feed URL is properly encoded. The
  biggest place this causes errors for folks is the Ampersand character. Instead of the
  "default" character, it needs to be encoded as "&amp;".  If you're getting deserialization
  errors when running the app, chances are this is the cause...
