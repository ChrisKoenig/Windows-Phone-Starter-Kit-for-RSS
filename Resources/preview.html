NOTES TO DEVELOPERS:

This template can be customized to make the preivew window display however you like. There are,
by default, only 4 "tokens" that are supported for replacement:

{{head.title}} - title of the rss feed item
{{body.foreground}} - the foreground (text) color for the feed item
{{body.background}} - the background color for the display window
{{body.content}} - this is the content of the feed text.

Depending on the feeds you're using, you might want to change the placement of these, but more
likely you'll want to customize the way the content is manage in the C# code rather than how it's
displayed here. Please refer to the MainViewModel class in the BuildHtmlForSelectedItem method.
